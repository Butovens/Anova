# Anova 

## This is an example of Anova (with variance/covariance) structure in R.

This study examines how anxiety might be alleviated. Thirty students were randomly assigned into three different therapy conditions to help them deal with their anxiety: 
* (1) no therapy, 
* (2) one-on-one therapy with a counselor
* (3) group therapy with many anxious students and one counselor. 

Students from each of the therapy groups were randomly assigned into two different exercise programs: 
* (1) individual exercise,
* (2) group exercise (e.g., a structured exercise class with a group). 

This was a fully crossed design and all group sizes were equal in that there were 10 students in each of the three therapy groups (5 from each exercise group) and 15 students in each of the two exercise groups (5 from each therapy group). Anxiety levels were gathered at three different (equally spaced) time points.
